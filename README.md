My Dotfiles
===========

In this repository I track changes to my Linux configuration files and scripts.
This includes my vim configuration (`.vimrc` and the `.vim` directory), my xterm
settings (`.Xresources`) and my tmux configuration (`.tmux.conf`).

The `scripts` directory contains some useful shell scripts, including a
bookmarking script, a script for managing file templates and a snippet
management script.  Man pages for some scripts can be found in the
`scripts/manpages` folder.
